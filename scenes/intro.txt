10 years later
(In the vast and windy grassland)
Me: When I was a child there was a humongous fire in my town...
It was a malicious and dangerous night...
The fire spread rapidly and spared no one.
Be it a child or a damsel, the flame burned and demolished everything in its path...
I didnt expect to make it out alive in such a dangerous situation...
But thanks to my hero who saved me, I barely managed to...
The night after the incident. I was told that a knight saved me...
It was Sir Lancelot, a Knight Of The Round Table...
Being inspired by my hero, I decided to become a remarkable knight, like Sir Lancelot...
and join the round table to bring honour to our land...
