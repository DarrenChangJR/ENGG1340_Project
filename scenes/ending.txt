The clash of armour, swords, and shields
Ceased by a fatal strike of your blade.
Your foe lies lifeless on the batlefield
Your foe, "Mordred, the Renegade".
 
The people of Camelot sing songs of your fight
None is stranger to your loyalty and might
"God bless the protector of our king and land,
The slayer of Mordred - the hero of Camlann"
